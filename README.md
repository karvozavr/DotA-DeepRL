# DotA-DeepRL

- You can run this bot using environment defined in `environment.py`.
- You can run learning using `learn.py`
(you need to setup `dota2runer.py` click the right buttons to start and restart the game, this is the only workaround I could find. Btw: windowed mode 1600*900 on 1920*1080 screen). 
- More sutable python package and documentation coming soon.
